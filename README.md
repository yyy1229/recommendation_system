## build algorithms that can read a digit.

- The first step in building an algorithm is to understand what are the outcomes and features.

- Below are three images of written digits.

- These have already been read by a human and assigned an outcome $Y$.

- These are considered known and serve as the training set.

- The images are converted into $28 \times 28 = 784$ pixels and, for each pixel, we obtain a grey scale intensity between 0 (white) and 255 (black), which we consider continuous for now.




## Recommendation systems

- Recommendation systems use ratings that _users_ have given _items_ to make specific recommendations.

- Companies that sell many products to many customers and permit these customers to rate their products, like Amazon, are able to collect massive datasets that can be used to predict what rating a particular user will give a specific item.

- Items for which a high rating is predicted for a given user are then recommended to that user.

- Netflix uses a recommendation system to predict how many _stars_ a user will give a specific movie.
